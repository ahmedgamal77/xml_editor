# xml_editor

**XML** ```(Extensible Markup Language)``` is one of the most famous formats for storing and sharing information among different devices.

## In this project we built the following features:

* A GUI in which the user can specify the location of an input XML file. 

* Checking the XML consistency: if the input XML have inconsistencies like missing any of the closing and opening tags or not matching tags, The program will be able to automatically solve the errors. 

* Converting XML to JSON: **JSON** ```(Javascript Object Notation)``` is another format that is used to represent data. It’s helpful to convert the XML into JSON, especially when using javascript as there’s tons of libraries and tools that use json notation. 

* Formatting (Prettifying) the XML: the XML file should be well formatted by keeping the indentation for each level
