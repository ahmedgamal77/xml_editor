# xml_editor
**XML** ```(Extensible Markup Language)``` is one of the most famous formats for storing and sharing information among different devices.

## In this project we built the following features:

* A GUI in which the user can specify the location of an input XML file.

* Checking the XML consistency: If the input XML have inconsistencies like missing any of the closing and opening tags or not matching tags, the program will be able to automatically solve the errors. 

* Converting XML to JSON: **JSON** ```(Javascript Object Notation)``` is another format that is used to represent data.

* Formatting (Prettifying) the XML: the XML file will be well formatted by keeping the indentation for each level.
